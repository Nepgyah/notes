## Branches
---
**Core Branches**
Development branch: `trunk / dev / main`
Production branch: `production / release`
### Naming branches
- Use a prefix for each branch to indicate purpose
	- `feature/` - New features or functionality
	- `bugfix/` - Fixing bugs
	- `refactor/` - Improving code structure without changing functionality
	- `test/` - Writing and improving testing
	- `doc`/ - Documentation updates
	- `chore/` - Dev only tasks
- Use hyphens `-` to separate words

## Commits
---
### Naming commits
- Use a prefix for each commit
	- `feat` - new feature/functionality of the main feature
	- `fix` - bug fix
	- `docs` - documentation
	- `style` - formatting, no logic changes
	- `refactor` - code change that is not a fix or feature
	- `test` - adding or fixing tests
	- `chore` - CI, tooling
- **Example**: feat: implement email/password login
- Write imperative commit subjects
	- Good `implement email/password login`
	- Bad `Fixed bug`
- Tip: If done correctly, the subject will complete the sentence `If merged, this commit will...`

## Pull-Requests
---
Squash a merge commits when making a pull request. 
```
Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they arenâ€™t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit when merging to the default branch, the changes are consolidated, leading to a clear Git history. - GitHub Official
```
Pull request summary text - Branch name
Pull request context text - Title of all squashed commits in order by date
## Version journey example
- Create branch of `develop`: `feature/anime-model`
	- Code and commit
		- `feat: create anime model`
		- `feat: create character model`
		- `chore: create migrations for anime/character model`
		- `test: anime model unit test`
		- `fix: anime model field requirements`
	- Squash: `feat: add anime model`
- Create another branch: `feature/user-anime-list`
	- Code and commit
		- `feat: create animeList model`
		- `chore: create migration for animeList model`
		- `feat: add animeList fk to user`
	- Squash: `feat: add animeList fk to user model`
- Pull request to `develop` branch
- History of `develop`:
	- `feat: add anime model` <- Pull request name
	- `feat: add animeList fk to user model` <- Pull request name
